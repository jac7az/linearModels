        "Dummies created through one-hot-encoded variables help transform categorical variables into a binary format with 0s and 1s so models can interpret the results. Each possible output become their own variable, called dummy variables. One of these dummy variable categories will be dropped, serving as a \"reference\" to compare. The coefficients generated is a comparison between the that variable and the dropped reference variable.\n",

        "The likelihood of the model overfitting increases as model becomes more complex, taking irrelevant, low-influence or unimportant data points to build predictions and invalid models. This usually happens when using too many variables, which would use too many of the training set's unique patterns. If the model doesn't work well with different datasets to test the accuracy of the model or has low accuracy measurements like R^2, then it means the model overfits the training set.\n",

        "Multi-colinearity occurs when 2+ input variables have high correlation, essentially doubling the same information within the pool of information the model has to learn from.

Clean the data however you think is most appropriate.\n",
        "  2. Summarize the `Price` variable and create a kernel density plot. Use `.groupby()` and `.describe()` to summarize prices by brand (`Make`). Make a grouped kernel density plot by `Make`. Which car brands are the most expensive? What do prices look like in general?\n",
        "  3. Split the data into an 80% training set and a 20% testing set.\n",
        "  4. Make a model where you regress price on the numeric variables alone; what is the $R^2$ and `RMSE` on the training set and test set? Make a second model where, for the categorical variables, you regress price on a model comprised of one-hot encoded regressors/features alone (you can use `pd.get_dummies()`; be careful of the dummy variable trap); what is the $R^2$ and `RMSE` on the test set? Which model performs better on the test set? Make a third model that combines all the regressors from the previous two; what is the $R^2$ and `RMSE` on the test set? Does the joint model perform better or worse, and by home much?\n",

As you increase the degree of the expansion, how do the $R^2$ and `RMSE` change? At what point does $R^2$ go negative on the test set? For your best model with expanded features, what is the $R^2$ and `RMSE`? How does it compare to your best model from part 4?\n",
        "  6. For your best model so far, determine the predicted values for the test data and plot them against the true values. Do the predicted values and true values roughly line up along the diagonal, or not? Compute the residuals/errors for the test data and create a kernel density plot. Do the residuals look roughly bell-shaped around zero? Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of your model."

Estimate your best model, predict the survival probability by age, and plot your results conditional on receiving a transplant and not. Describe what you see.\n",

        "**Q5.** This is a question about linear regression. The outcome is whether a defendant is held pre-trial in the Virginia justice system. We would like to understand how that outcome is predicted by characteristics of the defendant, particularly race. Let's be very careful/clear: We aren't saying anyone *should* be held without bond or asserting that people with different demographic variables *should* be more likely to be held, but instead trying to predict whether people with different characteristics *are empirically more likely* to be held without bond, given the available information. This is the first step we would take in investigating whether a system is fair, or how large the disparities are: Does it treat people with similar observable characteristics similarly, or not? We are going to look at a common question: Are Black defendants treated differently from white or Asian ones? (There are Native American defendants, but there are 11 in total, which is such a small number of observations that is difficult to clearly say anything about how this group is treated relative to the others.)\n",
        "\n",
        "The variables in the data are:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - `held_wo_bail`: Whether a defendant is held without bail before trial (Boolean logical)\n",
        "  - `race`, `sex`: Categorical demographic variables\n",
        "  - `is_poor`: Whether the defendant is classified as indigent\n",
        "  - `prior_F`, `prior_M`: The number of prior felony and misdemeanor arrests\n",
        "  - `case_type`: A categorical variable indicating a misdemeanor `M` or felony `F` or infraction `I` or special case `S`\n",
        "  - `age`: Defendant's age\n",
        "  - `bond`, `bond_NA`, `bond_type`: The amount of any bond, whether it is missing, and the type\n",
        "  - `sentence`, `sentence_NA`, `sentence_type`: The length of any sentence, whether it is missing, and the type\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Load the `pretrial_data.csv` data. Notice that there are `nan`s, but the data are relatively clean. Because there are `.nan`s among variables you won't use, you'll want to narrow down your analysis to the relevant variables before dropping or imputing missing values.\n",
        "2. Create a dummy variable indicating that the defendant is Black.\n",
        "3. Regress `held` on `Black`. What is the slope coefficient Interpret the coefficient on the Black dummy variable: How much more likely is a black person to be held without bail? What is the $R^2$ of the model?\n",
        "4. Before doing this question, please think for a few minutes about how to make the process of running the following regressions as efficient as possible, before jumping into writing code. Repeat part 2, for the following specifications, keeping track of the coefficient on the Black dummy variable each time:\n",

        "      - `held` on `Black` and `sex` and `is_poor` and `prior_F` and `case_type`\n",
        "What happens to the coefficient on the Black dummy variable as you include more regressors/features/controls in the regression? Explain your findings.\n",
        "5. Suppose we don't want to see just `Black` and `sex`, but `Black` interacted with `sex`: Are Black men and Black women treated systemically differently from the rest of the population? Implement this in a regression, and explain your findings.\n",
        "6. Imagine someone argued we should use these kinds of models to help a judge or magistrate make bail decisions (you could obviously go back and make this kind of model for the bond and sentence variables, then deploy it on new cases to predict what their bond and sentence values would be). What concerns would you have? Do you think society should be using data-driven and automated tools like that? Explain your concerns clearly."
